  description: >
    CityCAT (City Catchment Analysis Tool) is a unique software tool for modelling, analysis and visualisation of surface water flooding.
    CityCAT enables rapid assessment of combined pluvial and fluvial flood risk and allows assessment of the effects of different flood alleviation measures.
    This DAFNI model generates input data for CityCAT, runs a simulation and then converts the output data.
    All input data is assumed to be projected in [OSGB 1936](https://epsg.io/27700).
    The domain is generated either using a boundary polygon or a combination of centroid location and size.
    A rainfall total can either be specified directly or extracted from FUTURE-DRAINAGE based on a return period, duration and time horizon.
    The storm profile is generated using the FEH summer profile.
    The effects of buildings, green areas and inflow boundary conditions can be included.
    Results are provided in a range of formats and a metadata JSON file is created which can be used to create DAFNI datasets.

      - name: RAINFALL_MODE
        title: Rainfall mode
        type: string
        description:
          If `RAINFALL_MODE` is set to "return_period" then the rainfall depth corresponding to the `DURATION` and `RETURN_PERIOD` are extracted from the relevant CSV file in the `future-drainage` dataslot.
          If the `TIME_HORIZON` is anything other than "baseline", the rainfall depth is then uplifted by the percentage given in the CSV file.
          If `RAINFALL_MODE` is set to "total_depth" then the `TOTAL_DEPTH` parameter is used to define the amount of rainfall and the `RETURN_PERIOD` and `TIME_HORIZON` parameters are ignored.
          The rainfall depth value, either directly provided or extracted from FUTURE-DRAINAGE, is used to generate a storm profile in combination with the summer profile and `DURATION` parameter.

      #     This parameter is only used if `RAINFALL_MODE` is set to "return_period".
      #     If this is provided, then data must be present in the `future-drainage` dataslot.

        description:
          The duration of the rainfall event.
          This value is used in combination with the rainfall depth and summer profile to generate a storm profile.
          If `RAINFALL_MODE` is "return_period", this value is also used to extract a rainfall depth from FUTURE-DRAINAGE.
